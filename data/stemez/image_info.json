    "question": "Generally, iteration means the repeated application of a numerical process or pattern of action. To illustrate a specific use of the idea of iteration, consider solving an equation of the form x = F(x). Here F is a differentiable function whose value can be computed for any given value of the real variable x (within a certain interval). Using the method of iteration, one starts with an initial approximation x_0, and computes the sequence x_1 = F(x_0), x_2 = F(x_1), x_3 = F(x_2), . . . Each computation of the type x_n+1 = F(x_n) is called an iteration. If the sequence{x_n} converges to a limiting value \\alpha, then one gets lim F(x_n) = F(\\alpha), so x = \\alpha satisfies the equation x = F(x). As n grows, one would like the numbers x_n to be better and better estimates of the desired root. One stops the iteration when sufficient accuracy has been attained. Consider the problem shown in the accompanying figure. Two curves, y_1 = e^x and y_2 = 3x intersect in the two places shown. The problem is to find the x coordinates of the two intersections. Find the root at x = 0.62 with an initial guess x_0 = 0 or x_0 = 1 and also the root at x = 1.51 with an initial guess x_0 = 2. Use the method of iteration discussed above.",

    "question": "Compare the processes of digestion in the hydra, flatworm and earthworm.",
    "answer": "Hydra utilizes extracellular digestion to break down relatively large organisms into small pieces which are then digested intracellularly by individual cells. Flatworms have some extracellular digestion in the cavity but most food is phagocytized and digested intracellularly in the cells lining the cavity. An earthworm has a complete digestive tract with most digestion being extracellular, utilizing the enzymes secreted by cells lining the tract."
